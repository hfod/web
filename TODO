- photos
    - drop-box directory per meeting/event directory
    - meeting/event type constructor enumerates and reads the above
    - how to reference specific photo within the drop-box dir without relying on name?
        - reference the pair: (directory, sha256 digest)
            - constructor then looks for the matching file
- prose
    - reference external markdown file, to be read by a model type constructor
- content address all runtime-referenced files: images, css, js, etc.
