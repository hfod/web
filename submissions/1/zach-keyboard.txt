Hey Siraaj,

Offered to do a hackfreeordie presentation. Seems like they are 5 min prez, then 5 min questions. Do you expect slides, or live demo, or just whatever goes?

5 mins is quick, so probably just gonna touch briefly on:
- keyboards in general, my keyboard journey
- prototyping experiments with cardboard / handwiring
- software side, setting up keyboard firmware in qmk

Lemme know if you need anything else from me.

Thanks!

Zach
