 # Hack name or short description
TradeOgre iOS app


# Hack full description
I wanted an iOS app for trading on TradeOgre.com, but one was not available. After poking around the website, I found public API specs and decided I would build the app myself. Using my extensive iOS knowledge and an app framework I developed myself, I built the app in about 2 weeks.
