An unusual meeting and a birth of a new format - problem talks.

Only Kevin, Kyle and Siraaj were able to make it and such low attendance isn't
great for the usual show-and-tell style presentations, so we decided to
try something different - we each talked about a current problem, a sticking
point and design decision conflicts in things we're currently working on.

Some new approach ideas were discussed (over tuna tartare, guacamole and beer)!

So from now on, on low attendance nights we will do the same.
