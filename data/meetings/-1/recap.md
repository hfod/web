According to legends, on September 10th, 2021, [Grant](/speakers/grant-peret/)
posted a message in [`#us-new-hampshire`][1] channel of
[Helium](https://www.helium.com/)'s [Discord server][2]:

> Would anyone be interested in a NH Helium meetup sometime?  Would love to
> meet everyone and forecast Helium's growth in NH!

A few of us answered the call and a month later we had a great time hanging out
at [Raven Labs](/hosts/raven-labs/) and getting to know each other.
