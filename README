Have photos to add?
-------------------

Submit a PR adding your photo files to `data/meetings/$id/photos/` where `$id`
is the sequential ID of the meeting. Filename ending in `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or
`.png` is interpreted as a photo and a file with the corresponding basename but
with `.txt` extension is interpreted as the caption to the photo.

For example: `foo.png` is a photo and `foo.txt` is its caption.
